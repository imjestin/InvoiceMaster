I want to generate a full-stack invoicing web application called "SkillyVoice" that replicates Zoho Invoice features and includes a custom revenue sharing feature.

Please build this using:

Frontend: React or Next.js with Tailwind CSS

Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL DB, Auth, Edge Functions, and Storage)

PDF Support: Use react-pdf or pdf-lib for invoice generation

Email: Use Resend or any SMTP to send invoices

üßæ Core Features to Implement:
1. Authentication
Signup/Login with Supabase Auth

Role-based access: admin, team_member

2. Client Management
CRUD for clients: name, email, phone, company

Search/filter clients by keyword

3. Project Management
Create projects linked to a client

Assign project name, description, deadline, and team members

Status: active, completed

4. Invoice System
Create invoice linked to a project

Add line items: description, quantity, rate, tax

Show subtotal, tax, and grand total

Generate invoice as PDF

Email invoice to client

Invoice statuses: draft, sent, paid, overdue

5. Recurring Invoices
Create recurring invoice templates

Set frequency: daily/weekly/monthly

Use Supabase Edge Functions to auto-generate

6. Dashboard
Show total revenue, paid/unpaid invoices, overdue count

Revenue chart over months

7. Revenue Sharing Feature (Custom)
For each project, assign team members with:

Name, role

Contribution as fixed amount or percentage

Optional: assign a commission to an agent

Once project is marked completed and invoice is paid, system automatically:

Splits the invoice total into:

Team member payouts (based on contributions)

Commission amount

Remaining company profit

Store and show split summary in a dedicated report

Export the summary as PDF or CSV

üíΩ Database Tables (in Supabase):
users: id, name, email, role

clients: id, name, email, company

projects: id, name, client_id, status

project_team_members: project_id, user_id, contribution, type (percentage/fixed)

invoices: id, project_id, line_items[], total, status

project_commissions: project_id, agent_name, rate (%)

project_split_summary: project_id, total_amount, team_total, commission, company_profit

üßë‚Äçüé® UI Requirements:
